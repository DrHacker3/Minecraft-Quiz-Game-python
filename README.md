A basic text based minecraft quiz game

<b>Instructions:</b>

Run the python file in a python 3 environment, make sure you have the time module installed (pip install time). WITHOUT looking at the code (that's cheating), follow the instructions that are printed out on the screen. When a question is asked you need to type out the answer in the terminal, if it gives you options to choose from you can enter the number corresponding with your answer or you can type the answer. At the end of the questions you will get a final score.
